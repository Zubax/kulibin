# Adversarial review/refine loop

After a change or milestone, or when prompted, dispatch fresh-context review agents at
MAXIMUM THINKING EFFORT, then consolidate, fix, and repeat.
The goal is adversarial, diverse, independent coverage.

The prompts given to the agents shall be extremely terse, at most a few sentences.
Giving excessive detail may constrain their thinking causing the tunnel vision syndrome.
They must be given the opportunity to look at the work without bias or prejudice.

## The reviewer pair

Run two reviewers in parallel per round:

- An *ultrathink* Claude agent with the FULL-SPECTRUM remit, in priority order: functional CORRECTNESS and
  ROBUSTNESS first, then SIMPLIFICATION opportunities, ARCHITECTURAL CLEANLINESS and CODE QUALITY,
  and POLICY/STYLE compliance with the project's own docs.

- Codex running the *most advanced model* in *ultra* effort focusing on CORRECTNESS only, to maximize perspective
  diversity and minimize blind spots.

## Reviewers are read-only

Review agents must not modify the worktree or run mutating commands. If one needs a mutable environment,
it copies the worktree elsewhere.

## Reviewers do not re-run the project test suites

The gates, if any, are already green at the reviewed commit;
re-running them duplicates work and, for the broad sessions, wastes minutes of compute per round.
State this in the reviewer prompts.

## Inputs are trusted — reject cybersec framing

This system is for trusted, well-meaning users, not a security boundary.
Corner cases arise from honest mistakes, never from adversaries.
Weigh every finding by its plausibility under honest use: a defect matters if a regular deployment or a
well-meaning user could plausibly trigger it, not if only a contrived hostile input can reach it.
Findings whose reproduction requires deliberately pathological scenarios are out of scope:
reject them outright at consolidation instead of hardening against them, and say so in the reviewer prompts.

A round is NOT unclean merely because such findings exist.
Long loops degrade into exactly this kind of hardening; treat a round
whose only findings are adversarial-input constructions as clean and stop.

## Consolidate and act

When all reviewers return, merge their findings, discard the noise, and fix what is real.

## Avoid scope creep

The loop always finds something, so every round can justify the next. That does not make a finding a mandate.
Each finding MUST be checked against the project's overall goal, not only the criterion you handed the reviewer.
Do not lose sight of the forest behind the trees.

After each iteration, re-read the original request and compare it to the diffstat.
If the work no longer resembles what was asked, stop and say so -- cutting back is the maintainer's call.

## When to stop

A round is clean when the reviewers surface only trivial feedback or none; the first clean round ends the loop.
Do not chase literal zero feedback: with no real issues left, agents degrade into nitpicking,
so a round is clean as soon as significant findings cease.

## Operational notes

High-effort agents can go silent for a long time — set generous timeouts and do not assume a quiet agent is stuck.
Have agents background long-running commands (tests especially); blocking on a foreground command
is a common cause of stream-idle timeouts.

Some headless agents hang waiting on stdin (like Codex) — redirect from `/dev/null`.

Retry agents that fail on a transient or connection error until they succeed.
If an agent gets stuck or hits a security guardrail, try resuming it first instead of restarting its work from scratch.
